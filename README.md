## Full Setup & Codebase Overview

CodeVibe is built with a modular, scalable architecture using the latest web technologies. Here’s how the codebase is structured and how to get started:

### 1. **Project Structure**

- `src/app/` — Main Next.js app directory, including pages, layouts, and API routes.
- `src/components/` — Reusable UI components (including Shadcn UI and custom components).
- `src/lib/` — Utility functions, hooks, and core logic.
- `src/trpc/` — tRPC client/server setup for type-safe API calls.
- `prisma/` — Prisma schema and migrations for database modeling.
- `public/` — Static assets (SVGs, images, etc).
- `sandbox-templates/` — Templates and scripts for sandboxed Next.js environments.

### 2. **Tech Stack**

- **Next.js** (App Router, SSR, API routes)
- **TypeScript** (type safety everywhere)
- **Prisma** (database ORM)
- **Tailwind CSS** (utility-first styling)
- **Shadcn UI** (modern, accessible React components)
- **Framer Motion** (animations)
- **tRPC** (end-to-end typesafe APIs)
- **Inngest** (event-driven serverless workflows)
- **E2B** (sandboxed code execution)

### 3. **Inngest Integration**

CodeVibe uses [Inngest](https://www.inngest.com/) to power event-driven workflows and serverless functions. Inngest enables scalable, reliable background jobs and automation. Learn more about Inngest at [inngest.com](https://www.inngest.com/) or their [GitHub](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js).
